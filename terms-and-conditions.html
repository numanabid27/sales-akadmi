                <h6>Requirements for Participation</h6>
                <p>Anyone can take part in the course at the educational institution, provided that the admission requirements have been determined and confirmed by the educational institution in an informal assessment procedure. If funding (e.g. according to SGB III) is claimed, the special admission requirements of the respective funding institute must also be met</p>
            </div>

            <div class="desription__inner">
                <h6>Registration</h6>
                <p>The registration must be made in writing.</p>
                <p>If funding (e.g. according to SGB III) is claimed, a corresponding written further training contract must be concluded.</p>
                <p>By concluding the contract, the participant accepts the conditions of participation and the general terms and conditions of the educational institution.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="desription__inner">
                <h6>Organization and process</h6>
                <p>The courses have a contractually agreed service period. They are offered on a full-time, part-time and part-time basis.</p>
                <p>The lectures for the course take place exclusively at the contractually agreed training location of the training provider. The participant’s place of residence during the self-study periods (e.g. to prepare for the exam, to complete the exercises, to write the thesis) can be freely chosen by the participant or is agreed between the participant and the funding institute or between the participant and the cost bearer of the measure</p>
                <p>The participant undertakes to comply with the performance period and the training plan. The same applies to the additional regulations agreed with the respective funding institute or cost bearer. Deviations are only possible in special cases and after consultation with the responsible authority.</p>
                <p>If the special regulation affects the educational institution (e.g. extension of the performance period), the participant is obliged to submit a written application. The application can be sent to the educational institution digitally or by post.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="desription__inner">
                <h6>Revocation and Termination</h6>
                <p>The following cancellation conditions apply to participation in the courses:</p>
                <p>The cancellation must be made in writing. The absence of the participant from a booked course is in no case considered as termination. Lecturers or tutors are not authorized to accept cancellations.</p>
                <p>As long as there is no written cancellation, the participant is obliged to pay the full course fees in any case.</p>
                <p>In the event of termination, the fees will be charged up to the end of the notice period, provided that training services have already been provided by the educational institution.</p>
                <p>If the training provider has not yet provided any training services, but access to the learning platform has already been set up for the participant, the participant is obliged to pay a basic fee of €65.</p>
                <p>The following cancellation conditions apply to the participant:</p>
                <p>If the participant is a consumer i. s.d. § 13 BGB, he is entitled to the following right of withdrawal. The consumer is a natural person who concludes a legal transaction for purposes that cannot be attributed to either their commercial or their independent professional activities.</p>
                <p>Right of withdrawal for participants as consumers i. s.d. § 13 BGB has a cancellation period of fourteen days from the day the contract was concluded. In this case, this contract can be revoked without giving reasons.</p>
                <p>In order to exercise this right of withdrawal, it is necessary to inform the training provider of the decision to withdraw by means of a clear written declaration (e.g. by post, fax or e-mail). Contact details of the training provider can be found in the imprint of the website www.syntax-institut.de, the course descriptions or the further education contract.</p>
                <p>In the case of measures that last longer than three months, termination is possible for the first time at the end of the three months with a notice period of no more than six weeks. After the three months have expired, termination is possible with immediate effect due to the termination of funding. The course fees are claimed pro rata.</p>
                <p>In the case of a measure shorter than three months, the contract can be terminated with immediate effect if the participant starts work or if the funding is terminated through no fault of the participant. The course fees are claimed pro rata.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="desription__inner">
                <h6>Technical requirements</h6>
                <p>The participant confirms his knowledge of the technical requirements (if necessary) for participation in the course. The participant is responsible for the hardware and software they use and for the communication channels they use. A failure of the hardware and software used by him does not release him from the obligation to pay the course fee and does not constitute the subject of a special termination.</p>
                <p>The educational institution is not liable for the security and continuity of data communication (e.g. for the purpose of transmitting exercises or thesis, registering for exams by e-mail), which is conducted via third-party communication networks.</p>
                <p>The training provider is also not liable for disruptions in data transmission caused by technical errors or configuration problems on the part of the user.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="desription__inner">
                <h6>Course fee due</h6>
                <p>Course fees are usually paid by the agreed course start date, but no later than fourteen days after the conclusion of the contract. The participant will receive a corresponding invoice upon registration.</p>
                <p>In the event of a deviating regulation, this is documented in the training contract. If the cost bearer of the measure is not the participant and the cost bearer wishes to be billed directly to the educational institution, the educational provider will approach the cost bearer with regard to the service billing. This also applies to a proportionate settlement of costs with third parties.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="desription__inner">
                <h6>Training Offer and Changes</h6>
                <p>The training provider carries out the respective course within the framework of the further training offer valid at the beginning of the course. The training provider is entitled to change the range of services if and to the extent that the fulfillment of the purpose of this contract is not significantly impaired. The participant will be informed of any changes by the educational institution. However, this should not change the training objective.</p>
                <p>Changing a teacher or tutor is not a significant change in this sense. The training provider reserves the right to cancel or reschedule the course dates announced in the training plan if the lecturer or tutor suddenly falls ill or in the event of other disruptions in business operations for which the training provider is not responsible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="desription__inner">
                <h6>Proof of performance</h6>
                <p>exams</p>
                <p>Registration for an examination must be made in consultation with the course supervisor. With the start of the examination, the examination is considered to have started and the examination performance is also evaluated.</p>
                <p>thesis</p>
                <p>Submission of a thesis must be preceded by approval of the topic by the tutor. The application for admission takes the form of a briefing. The tutor sends a message about the admission by e-mail. Compliance with the factual and formal requirements is required.Both the successful completion of the examinations and the submission of the final thesis must take place within the agreed performance period.</p>
                <p>Transcript</p>
                <p>The e-certificate is sent to the participant in digital form.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="desription__inner">
                <h6>Copy protection and exclusion from use</h6>
                <p>The educational institution is entitled to encode the digital content provided in order to prevent unauthorized use. The participant is not entitled to remove them. Violation of these Terms of Use may result in the participant being excluded from the course.</p>
               
            </div>

            <div class="desription__inner">
                <h6>Warranty and liability</h6>
                <p>If the information provided by the training provider is inaccurate or no longer up-to-date, the provider will provide the participant with correct and updated information. If the replacement delivery fails, the participant has the right to cancellation or reduction of the remuneration paid.</p>
                <p>The training provider is liable for intent and gross negligence, for slight negligence, however, only in the event of a breach of essential contractual obligations. In the event of a slightly negligent breach of a primary contractual obligation, the educational institution is liable at most to the extent of the typically foreseeable damage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="desription__inner">
                <h6>Subsidiary agreements/contractual agreement</h6>
                <p>Subsidiary agreements or further agreements must be in writing to be effective. Deviating written agreements in contracts between participants and training providers have priority.</p>
