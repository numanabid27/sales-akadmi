By activating Google signals, data is collected and linked to the Google account. This allows Google to recognize, for example, when you view a product on our website using a smartphone and only later buy the product using a laptop.

Remarketing means that we can also show you our offer on other websites. Google Analytics also collects additional visitor data such as location, search history, YouTube history and data about your actions on our website through the Google signals. This gives us better advertising reports and more useful information about your interests and demographics from Google. This includes your age, what language you speak, where you live or what gender you belong to. There are also social criteria such as your job, your marital status or your income. All of these features help Google Analytics to define groups of people or target groups. The reports also help us to better assess your behavior, your wishes and interests. This enables us to optimize and adapt our services and products for you. By default, this data expires after 26 months.
