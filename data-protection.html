Remarketing means that we can also show you our offer on other websites.

This includes your age, what language you speak, where you live or what gender you belong to. There are also social criteria such as your job, your marital status or your income. All of these features help Google Analytics to define groups of people or target groups. The reports also help us to better assess your behavior, your wishes and interests.
